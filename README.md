NYC-Taxi-Project 


This project utilized 2016 NYC taxicab trip data to build a model predicting average trip duration, comparing its accuracy against actual trip records. 
The dataset, sourced from Google Cloud Platform and NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, included fields like trip start/end times, passenger count, and geographic coordinates. Findings highlighted typical trip characteristics such as passenger counts averaging 1-2, occasional instances of zero passengers due to driver input, and outliers like unusually high passenger numbers possibly indicating limousine trips. 
Average trip duration was approximately 16 minutes over 3.94 km, with anomalies such as extremely short or long trips and implausible travel distances identified and addressed. Seasonal trends in trip pickups were noted, with peaks in March-April potentially linked to weather or tourist activity. 
The model, while predicting trip durations, didn't meet desired accuracy due to outliers and data inconsistencies, suggesting future improvements in feature engineering and consideration of alternative algorithms like decision trees could enhance predictions and refine operational insights for taxi services and customer satisfaction.
